     This site is very successful for many reasons! Firstly, I love the way the site deals with the varying aspect ratios of the Magritte's paintings. It makes the transistions very playful. 
     This sense of playful exploration extends to the subtle hover states (and even off states) of the buttons. Sound, image, video, and good typography (in most places) enhances the mystery and keeps me intrigued as I navigate this decade+ of Magritte's paintings. P.s. The drag to reaveal an x-ray of the paintings is nice too.
