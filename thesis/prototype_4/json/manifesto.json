At this time, however, with the proliferation of VR environments and Google Street View, spatial understanding is rarely comprised of the pure first person experience of a space. Tools for the design of public spaces have traditionally been high-level, viewing an urban space from William H. Whyte’s perspective — known for his birds-eye analytical footage of urban public spaces in the film The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces — and making decisions accordingly. Now that our understanding of ____ is changing, why hasn’t the design system / process changed too? Olafur Eliasson says that “[If] I have a sense of the space, if I feel that the space is tangible, if I feel there is time…I also feel that I can change the space.” By incorporating various design tools that play between the worlds of user input, designer control, and automation, I hope to present a system that is more in tune with how we experience public space. Allowing crucial entry points into a spaces design by way of the environmental conditions, materials, form, etc. will only assist in making these future spaces more participatory / collaborative / flexible."
