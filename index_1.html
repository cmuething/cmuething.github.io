     <strong>Leg Work Studio</strong> is just one of many portfolio/studio sites that have "interesting" loading graphics. This particular one is probably not the most visually interesting, but it conveys the point that for a site on which you will inevitably be loading hi-res images or graphics, it is necessary to include a loading graphic. It is also often the first thing that a visitor sees when they visit your site, thus giving them a first impression to the experience they are about to have and the work they are about to see.
