		<h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>
		
		<p>The MICA Design blog has long been a staple of the Graphic Design Department experience, but not in the way you would expect. There weren't troves of undergrads flocking to the site to discover the work of a professor or info about an upcoming event. The blog would probably be the last place anyone would look for a variety of resources. In fact, as we began our research process, the Google Analytics revealed that most of the traffic on the site is from the automatic load that occurs whenever you log onto a computer in the GD department. After meeting with the chair of the Graphic Design Department Brockett Horne, a few goals were established regarding the functionality and design of the new site. We set off intending to take this inward-facing blog and create something visually appealing that better represents that students of the Graphic Design Department.</p> 
		
		
		<h1> THE CURRENT SITE </h1>

		<p>The research process revealed many weaknesses both in the design and functionality of the current site. Of the interviews conducted, almost everyone said they did not visit the site on a regular basis. When asked directly about the functionality, they made specific references to the treatment of each individual item as well as the large type that remains fixed on all of the listing pages. But the over-arching reason for not using the site was lack of awareness or need for the content that the site provides.</p>

		<p>All of this useful information led to a restructuring of the site's navigation and content hierarchy. A focus was given to private content accessed by a user log-in which would give the blog the exclusivity of an interdepartmental blog while still being able to face the public. The below research and findings prompted my own personal explorations of the site and led directly into the design and interaction of my templates. </p>

		<p>After completing the interviews, it was clear that a very simple core interaction would solve many of the issues with the site as it stands. The initial design direction I explored was centered around a simple display of content in a scrolling column. Yet the more I thought about the needs of our intended audience, the more I considered an interaction based on something other than scrolling. When this re-designed site is complete, the user will have the option of toggling through 15 different series of templates and stylings of content. With the variety of designers we have in the class, the user is given the ability to pick their preferred template based on any number of factors. Taking this user customization principle a step further, I began to think about what the user is really looking at when he is toggling through these templates. The content itself is obviously the crux of the experience with the current site but now the user is presented with this content in 15 different ways. It is likely that any increase in traffic that occurs after this new site is launched will be as a direct result of the availability of the templates. We have reorganized the content, but it has not changed. Thus, I focused in on the interaction of toggling through different systems of content organization. This principle shaped the subsequent design and development decisions of this re-design.   </p>

		<p>Upon activating my template, the user is presented with a wire frame of a site. Besides the "MICA GRAPHIC DESIGN" presented on the entrance image, the site is locked in pre-content form. The typography, Balto and Caxton, represent a current and past history of our field. Balto, designed by MICA Faculty member Tal Lemming, is designed with screen in mind and draws influences from the American Gothic faces, but with a clear Baltimore influence. Caxton was designed by Leslie Underwood and references William Caxton, the first English man to work in printing. Once the user starts to explore the page, content is revealed and access to the content is granted. Within the rigidity of the system, there is flexibility in the type of experience the user wishes to have. </p>
